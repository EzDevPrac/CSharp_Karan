**FACTORY DESIGN PATTERN**

1. Design patterns are all about reusable solutions for a common problem.
2. The 23 group of four are the foundation for the entire pattern
3. They are classified into 3 groups
     i) Creational
    ii) Structural
   iii) Behavioural
4. Factory pattern comes under the creational group.
   *  Factory method is a design pattern which defines interface for creating an object but lets
      the class that implementing the interface decide which class to instantiate
   *  Interfaces cannot have variables/fields , they can only have properties or methods.
   *  It provides the client with a simple way to create the object.

  1. Product: Define the interface of the object the factory method creates.
  2. Concrete Product: This is a class that implements the product interface
  3. Creator: An abstract class and it declares the factory methods which returns a object of
     type product.
  4. Concrete Creator: Implements the creator class and overrides the factory methods

**BUILDER DESIGN PATTERN:**
*  This also falls under the category of creational design pattern.
*  This pattern is used to build complex object by using a step by step approach.
*  The main idea is **“Separate the construction of complex object from its representation so that the same construction 
    process can create different representation”.**


 
![alt text]()

1.  **Builder**: this is an interface which is used to define all the steps required to the product
2.  **Concrete Builder**: This is a class which implements the builder interface to create a complex product.
3.  **Product**: this is a class which defines the part of the complex object which are to be generated by the builder pattern
4.  **Director**: This is a class that is used to construct object using the builder interface.

**Command Design Pattern:**


It falls under behavioral patter.
It is commonly used in the menu system of many applications such as Editor,IDE etc
In this pattern a request is wrapped under an object as a command and passed to invoker object . The invoker object pass the 
    command to the appropriate object which can handle it and that object executes the command.
*  UML diagram:
   ![alt text]()
1.  Client Class --> Creates and executes the command object
2.  Invoker  --> Asks the command to carry out the action
3.  Command --> This is an interface which specifies the execute operation
4.  Concrete Command --> Class that implements the execute operation by invoking on the receiver
5.  Receiver class --> Class that performs the Action Associated with the Request
